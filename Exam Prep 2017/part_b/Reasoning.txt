Everything starts with a random initialisation hence the random nature.

As time progresses some random groups of colours will form. In regions where
there is a higher density of one colour over the others there is an increases
luminosity of attempts to change to be an adjasent colour. Where p=1 this always
happens.

This results in larger regions of a particular colour.

Since we are only considering nearest neighbours in a '+' shape then either
vertical or horizontal phases will form grouping each colour.

Random fluctuations resulting in the random selection of which cell to be
updated results in some colours growing larger than others. This in turn further
increases the spread of that colour.

Again from random fluctuations receding colours may fight back and grow again.

In the end one colour will be overwhelmingly likley change to the dominant
colour resulting in the end board being all one colour.
